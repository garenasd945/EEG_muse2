## What is this?
This script will take EEG brainwaves and create a static dataset through a sliding window approach. Overlapping windows consider wave data and many mathematical attributes are generated in order to describe the wave. This means for Machine Learning you're not classifying point-data and thus temporal techniques such as an LSTM are no longer necessary 

## Usage
There is demo Muse EEG data under *dataset/original_data/*

Notice that there is a noise column at the end of the CSV, this would be the Right AUX input to the Muse. The script will ignore this column, so make sure you add a column of zeroes to the end.

python src/generateTrainingMatrix.py dataset/original_data/ out.csv

## Where do these features come from?
We have been slowly growing this list of features over time through multiple research papers. If you do use this, please be sure to cite **all** related works:

[A Study on Mental State Classification using EEG-based Brain-Machine Interface](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8710576) - this work first proposes the technique and features. We used them to classify mental state.

## What features are generated?
Please see [this work](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-29933-0_37) for the full description of features generated (I removed them from here because the readme got far too long!)




## To Do
Make the final column to be ignored optional
Add more features
Diagrams for this readme to show what is going on a bit better
